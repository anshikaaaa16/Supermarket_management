This is a basic **Marketing Management System** designed for a supermarket. The system is a command-line interface that allows the user to manage a list of items available in the store. It provides four primary options:

### Features:

1. **Add New Items**:
   - Users can add new items to the supermarket's inventory.
   - The system prompts the user for the item name, quantity, and price.
   - Input validation ensures that quantity and price are entered as numeric values.
   - Once the item is successfully added, it is stored in the inventory list.

2. **View Items**:
   - Users can view the list of all items currently available in the inventory.
   - The system displays the total number of items and their details, including name, quantity, and price.

3. **Purchase Items**:
   - Users can purchase items from the store.
   - The system prompts the user to enter the name of the item they wish to purchase.
   - If the item is available (i.e., quantity is greater than 0), the user is informed of the price to pay at the checkout counter.
   - After purchasing, the item is removed from the inventory list.
   - If the item is out of stock, the user is notified accordingly.

4. **Exit**:
   - Allows the user to exit the system.

### User Interaction:
- The system continuously prompts the user for their desired action until the user decides to exit by selecting option "4".
- Input validation is incorporated to ensure smooth operation and prevent errors.

This system is ideal for managing small to medium-sized inventories in a supermarket setting, allowing for basic item management and purchasing functionality.
